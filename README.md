Description of Project:
- This school project is a portfolio site design for a made-up client by the name of Alex Morgan.
- Morgan is a freelance photographer/digital artist who tends to work with a minimalistic and abstract art style, likes to use black, white, grey and a less saturated tone of colors, and creates some impactful photographies.
- This site aims to help Morgan attract potential clients and commissioners and stand out amongst a sea of other beautiful portfolios, because often scan portfolios briefly before deciding whether to explore further. The site also helps the clients quickly understand the artist’s style and specialty.

Design changes from Assignment 1:
-  Expanding the website from only a landing page to three pages
-  Simplifyed the Contacts page, removing the icons of social media since I can't really figure out how to generate those
-  Change of portfolio pieces, replacing some work with more distinctive paintings
-  Change of color at the About section, from bright to a greyish tone

Documentation of AI use:
- Use of Google Gemini to help me on strengthening the use of grid formats
- Use of Google Gemini to help generate an overall structure of the About Section
